# Customer Targeting Model ðŸŽ¯

# Description:

This project aims to identify the top B2B customers of a super server company who are most likely to purchase products after a marketing campaign. By using a segmentation strategy, the model helps optimize the marketing budget by targeting only those customers with a high likelihood of conversion.

We utilized a labeled dataset of customer records and applied supervised learning techniques to train the model. Specifically, a Gradient Boosting Classifier was used to predict which customers will respond positively to the marketing campaign. Due to data imbalance, random under-sampling was employed to balance the dataset. Out of 34 features available, 28 were selected for training the model to enhance its predictive accuracy.

# Key Components:

# Tools Used: 
Python, Jupyter Notebook, MS Excel

# Machine Learning Algorithm: 
Gradient Boosting Classifier

# Data Handling: 
Random under-sampling to address data imbalance

# This project provides a data-driven approach to customer targeting, enabling more effective marketing campaigns and higher return on investment.
